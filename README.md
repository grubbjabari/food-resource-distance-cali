# Food Resource Distance in California

## About

This is a Python program that was created in order to determine someone's distance to a Food Resource in Cali and orders them. 
This was created after hearing from nearby Food Resources near where I live said that they often couldn't give away enough food before it went bad.
Which spurred the thought that there could be an issue of people not having enough access to the facilities in order to reach them. 
To start testing out my hypothesis I started calculating the amount of time it would take to walk to a Food Resource in California.
Then organize that data by the length of time if would take for someone to walk there from it's coordinates. 

Orders over 1000+ results from
